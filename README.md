There are certain reasons that make creating your own React configuration make sense. You are likely good with React and you want to learn how to use tools like webpack and Babel on your own. These build tools are powerful, and if you have some extra time, itâ€™s always good to learn about them.

So I have ejected react-script and configured babel and webpack on my own.
